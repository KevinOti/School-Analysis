-- Analyzing data
-- In the Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores project, you'll work with a SQL database containing the SAT 
-- (Scholastic Aptitude Test) scores from New York City's public schools to determine test performance across those schools. 
-- You'll look at the following aspects:

-- How many schools fail to report information
-- Which (or how many) schools are best/worst in each of the three components of the SATâ€”reading, math, and writing
-- The best/worst scores for different SAT components
-- The top 10 schools by average total SAT scores
-- How the test performance varies by borough
-- The top 5 schools by average SAT scores across all three components (or for a certain component) for a selected borough

-- Schools that fail to sumit their information
select 
count(school_name)
from sat_data
where borough is null
-- For borough all the schools submitted their details


select 
count(borough)

where average_math is null

where average_reading is null
